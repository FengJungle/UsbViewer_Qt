Introduction:

1. This is a demo application which can list all PNP devices on your computer, just like the Device Manager, I called UsbViewer. 

2. Actually, now the program just lists four kinds of devices, not all. They are USB devices, System devices, 
Net devices, Keyboard and Mouse. I just show these kinds and codes for example. These example codes are enough
 for you to expand to other devices.
 
3. The application is coded in C, C++ and Qt5.6.0. 

4. I add a simple but useful log system into the UsbViewer. The log system is also implemented by me. For more information about the log system, please visit the CSDN blog: https://blog.csdn.net/sinat_21107433/article/details/103102542.
